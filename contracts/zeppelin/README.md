# OpenZeppelin Solidity Contracts

These contracts are a subset of contracts published at https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts

All files in this directory are copied from zeppelin release 1.3.0 to ensure we track in our git history any updates to any smart contract code dependencies. The only modification to this version is explicit addition of the `public` function modifier as well as changing `constant` to `pure` where applicable, to avoid solidity compiler warnings. This is an open issue / pending PR in the zeppelin repo: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/issues/511

The LICENSE file in this folder is also copied unmodified from the OpenZeppelin repo.

The Orchid Labs team is grateful to the OpenZeppelin team for their contributions in making secure smart contract dependencies.
